Game Data File ( GDF ) Format Version 5.1

The following describes the general format of version 5.0 of a game data file. You may create
higher versions with added features if you wish, but they should be backwards compatible with
version 5.0. The only change from version 4.0 to version 5.0 is that the Character type and
PlaceID are now on separate lines. It is recommended that any new versions you create be
numbered 5.1, 5.2, etc.

GDF 5.0 Environment Name // Magic word, version number and environment name.
// Comments are ignored, as are blank lines

--------------------------------------- PLACES ---------------------------------------

PLACES nPlaces // Place section keyword, followed by an integer number of places, > 0
	       // By default the first place listed is the starting point for this 
	       //  environment. See also below.
ID long_name_with_spaces // ID is a unique integer, = 2, in the range of a 32-bit signed int
			 // ID numbers 0 and 1 are reserved
			 // All ID numbers are non-negative ( see below )
			 // followed by the name of the Place ( remainder of line except comments )
ndescr 			 // Number of description lines to follow, an integer > 0
description 		 // ndescr lines of text describing the Place

--------------------------------------- DIRECTIONS --------------------------------------- 

DIRECTIONS nDirections // Direction section keyword, followed by a number of directions >0
ID source direction destination lockPattern
		// ID is a unique integer, = 0, in the range of 32-bit signed ints
		// source and destination correspond to Place IDs
		// A negative destination indicates a locked direction. 
		//  ( Actual destination is positive. )
		// Destination 1 exits the program
		// Destination 0 leads nowhere, and implies the direction is locked 
		//  and must stay locked
			// ( Provides for future expansion of the environment )
		// direction indicates the direction from source to destination, and must be one of:
			// N, S, E, W, U, D, NE, NW, SE, SW,
			// NNE, NNW, SSE, SSW, ENE, ESE, WNW, WSW
		// lockPattern is a 32-bit int, = 0, indicating the pattern of the 
		//  lock on this direction
			// lockPattern = 0 indicates there is no key that can change this lock status

--------------------------------------- CHARACTERS --------------------------------------- 

CHARACTERS nCharacters 	 // Character section keyword, and # of characters, = 0
TYPE 			 // For now TYPE must be one of PLAYER or NPC.
PlaceID 		 // PlaceID = 0
			 // PlaceID > 0 indicates the starting place for this character
			 // PlaceID = 0 indicates a random starting place for this character
ID 	long_name_with_spaces // ID is a unique positive integer, > 0
			 // Additional fields may be added in later versions of the GDF, as you wish.
ndescr 			 // Number of description lines to follow, an integer > 0
description 		 // ndescr lines of text describing the Place

--------------------------------------- ARTIFACTS --------------------------------------- 

ARTIFACTS nArtifacts 	 // Artifacts section keyword, followed by an integer # of artifacts, = 0
placeOrCharID 		 // Place where this artifact should be put initially.
			 // < 0 for a characters possessions. ( Character ID is the positive value. )
			 // = 0 to put the artifact in a random Place
			 // > 0 to put the artifact in a specified Place
ID   value   mobility   keyPattern   name
			 // ID is a unique integer, > 0, in the range of 32-bit signed ints
			 	// ID >= 100 -- Weapons
			 	// ID >= 200 -- Potions
			 	// ID >= 300 -- Magical Items
			 	// ID >= 400 -- Craftable Items
			 	// ID >= 500 -- Scrolls
			 	// ID >= 600 -- Maps
			 	// ID >= 700 -- Keys
			 	// ID otherwise is a regular artifact or gem
			 // value can be used for scoring points, or eventually for bartering 
			 //  & trade ( integer )
			 // mobility is < 0 for immovable objects, = 0 for movable objects ( integer )
			 // keyPattern is a 32-bit int, = 0. This key operates any item 
			 //  with a matching lockPattern
			 // keyPattern = 0 opens no locks
			 // name allows user to refer to this object, and may contain spaces 
			 //  but not tabs
			 // Additional fields may be added in later versions of the GDF, as you wish.
metaData		 // additional information for the artifact (damage, quantity, etc)
ndescr 			 // Number of description lines to follow
description 		 // ndescr lines of text describing the Artifact

--------------------------------------- RECIPES ---------------------------------------

RECIPES nRecipes		// Recipe section keyword, followed by an integer # of recipes, = 0
long_name_with_spaces		// Name of the Recipes with spaces
ID   quantity   metaData	// ID of the recipe, quantity of material required to craft
				// meta data -- what the artifact crafted will affect (shield)
artifact_ID(s)			// can be one or multiple, this artifact is required to be in player
				//  possession inorder for new artifact to be crafted
ndescr				// Number of description lines to follow
description			// ndescr lines of text describing the crafted Artifact



// Higher versions of the GDF file format may contain additional sections.
// All sections are required, but CHARACTERS and ARTIFACTS may have zero items.
